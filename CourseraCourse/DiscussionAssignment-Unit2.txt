While Loop:

public class DiscussionAssignment {
public static void main(String[] args) {
int i = 0;
while (i < 6) {
System.out.println(i);
i++;
}
}
}


Do-while loop:

public class DiscussionAssignment{
public static void main(String[] args) {
int i = 0;
do {
System.out.println(i);
i++;
}
while (i < 6);
}
}

For Loop:
public class DiscussionAssignment {
public static void main(String[] args) {
for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
System.out.println(i);
}
}
}

A "While" Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code an unknown number of times, until a condition is met while a “do while” loop is a control flow statement that executes a block of code at least once, and then repeatedly executes the block, or not, depending on a given Boolean condition at the end of the block.

A for-loop is a control flow statement for specifying iteration, which allows code to be executed repeatedly.
